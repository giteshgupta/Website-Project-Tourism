					"The Golden Temple, or Golden Gurudwara is the holiest shrine of Sikhs. It was built in late 16th century by Guru Arjan Dev, and a copy of the Sikh scripture was placed inside the Gurudwara in 1604. Its sanctum walls were covered in marble and the dome was decorated with gold foil by Maharaja Ranjit Singh in the 19th century.[2] More than 100,000 people visit this monument every month

                    Sri Harmandir Sahib is the official name of the Golden Gurudwara.[1] It is in the city of Amritsar, Punjab, India. The Gurudwara is surrounded by a sacred pool and group of buildings important to the Sikh religion. The complex is the most important pilgrimage site in Sikhism and it is also called Darbar Sahib. One of these buildings in the complex is the Akal Takht, the highest religious
                     authority for Khalsa Sikhs. Another building is the langar, where a free simple vegetarian meal is served to all without any discrimination. The Gurudwara is a place of worship for men and women from all walks of life and all religions to come and worship God. The four entrances (representing the four directions) to get into the Harmandir Sahib also symbolise the openness of the Sikhs towards
                      all people and religions.[3]"</p>
